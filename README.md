## Project Information
"What would Conway's Game of Life sound like if it could create music along with it's visualization?"

This project is geared towards answering that question!

It utilizes the Web Audio API to generate sounds randomly as life is generated. You will note that when "life" is bustling, the music is booming. When it has slowed down, so will the music.
